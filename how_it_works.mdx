The [API](/api-reference) is the main way to interact with the platform. It allows you to create and manage agents, place outbound calls, and receive inbound calls.

# Agents

`Agent` is a fancy word for an AI configuration that can be used in both inbound and outbound phone calls. (Coming soon, you'll also be able to use your agents on web with a snippet!)

You can specify the agent's voice, context, and other properties. You can use an agent's `id` when placing an outbound call or create an `InboundPhone` that will use the agent when receiving inbound calls.

## Callback URL

As part of the `Agent`, you can specify a `callbackUrl`. This is your server's URL that the agent will use when retreiving context, performing function calls, and sending call summaries / recordings.

### Retreiving Context

If you need to customize the agent's context based on who the user is, or to retrieve context from your database, you can enable `getContextFromCallback` when creating an agent.

If `getContextFromCallback` is enabled and a call begins, the agent will make a `GET` request to the `callbackUrl` with the `userPhoneNumber` and `agentId` as query parameters. Your server should respond with a JSON object containing the context, like so:

```json
{
  "context": "You are an assistant at a law firm. You are calling to confirm an appointment with a client."
}
```

### Function Calling

Vapi fully supports [OpenAI's function calling API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling), so you can have agents ping your server to perform actions like sending emails, retrieve information, and more. GPT-4 will automatically determine what functions to call based on the context you provide and the user's input.

If `functions` are defined on the agent, it will use the `callbackUrl` to make a `POST` request with the following body:

<Snippet file="function.body.mdx" />

Your server should respond with a JSON object containing the function's response, like so:

```json
{
  "result": "Your email has been sent."
}
```

### End of Call Report

When a call ends, the agent will make a `POST` request to the `callbackUrl` with the following body:

<Snippet file="end.body.mdx" />

# Inbound Phone Calls

An `InboundPhone` is a configuration that maps a phone number to an agent. When a call is received on the phone number, the agent will be used to handle the call.

When creating an `InboundPhone`, it uses your Twilio API keys to configure the provided phone number to forward calls to Vapi. You can also specify a `forwardingPhoneNumber`, which the agent can use to forward the call to a human if it can't handle a request or a user asks.

# Outbound Phone Calls

An `OutboundCall` will initiate a phone call to the `userPhoneNumber` from the `twilioPhoneNumber`, with the provided agent.

An [existing agent](/api-reference/outbound_call/create) can be specified by its `id`, or you can create a [transient agent](/api-reference/outbound_call/create.transient) on the fly.
